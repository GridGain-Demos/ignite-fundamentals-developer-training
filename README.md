# Apache Ignite Foundations Developer Training

New to Apache Ignite? This 90 minute hands-on training webinar is the fastest way for Java developers to get started with Ignite 3. In this session, you’ll learn how to spin up an Ignite cluster, connect a Java application, and work with distributed data using Ignite’s Java and SQL APIs.

We’ll cover the core building blocks of Ignite – tables, schemas, partitioning, and replication – and show how they translate into Java code. By the end of the session, you’ll understand how Ignite works, why it delivers high performance at scale, and how to start building your own Ignite-powered applications with confidence.

## What You’ll Learn
* How Apache Ignite 3 is structured and where it fits in modern Java architectures
* How to start and initialize an Ignite cluster
* How to connect to Ignite using the Java client
* How to create tables, insert data, and run queries using SQL and the Java API
* How Ignite distributes data (partitioning, replication, colocation) and why it matters

## Agenda
1. Introduction to Apache Ignite 3: What Ignite is and when to use it
2. Cluster Basics: Starting and initializing an Ignite cluster
3. Connecting with Java: Java client setup and configuration
4. Working with Data:
  * Tables, SQL queries, and Java table APIs
  * Common access patterns (RecordView, KeyValueView)
5. Distributed Data Fundamentals: Partitioning, replication, and performance basics

## Who should attend
Java developers, architects, and engineers evaluating Apache Ignite or getting started with Ignite 3 for distributed data and high-performance applications.
